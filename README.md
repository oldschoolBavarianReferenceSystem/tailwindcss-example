# Tailwind CSS Example

This is just a small npm/nodejs project to play with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), without
any complex frameworks like Angular or SCSS handling. It just uses plain HTML
and Tailwind CSS. Still, this has some ideas taken from 
[wweb.dev](https://wweb.dev/blog/how-to-create-static-website-npm-scripts#html).

Usage: 

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

This will serve your files and re-build them with browsersync.
